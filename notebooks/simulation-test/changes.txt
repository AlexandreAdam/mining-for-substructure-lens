Changes proposed to simulator:
- Turn off scatter in sigma_v to halo mass mapping (DONE, added option)
- Have upper cutoff (~0.01 * M_host) in subhalo mass (check literature) (DONE)
- Switch to parameterization based on f_sub rather than n_calib (check literature) (DONE)
- Get Einstein radius straight from sigma_v, no scatter (DONE)
- Restrict range of lens redshift (DONE)
- Increase range of host mass (DONE)
- Don't draw from mvgauss---put in by hand (DONE)
- Don't consider configurations with subhalo fraction > 1 (DONE)

Advocate:
- Restricting \beta range (-2.5 to -1.5?)
- Save distances instead of redshifts?
- Save f_sub for diagnostic purposes
- Consider restricted f_sub definition, like n_calib?

There is less substructure fractions in general compared to before
