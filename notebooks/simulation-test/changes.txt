Changes proposed to simulator:
- Turn off scatter in sigma_v to halo mass mapping (DONE, added option)
- Have upper cutoff (~0.01 * M_host) in subhalo mass (check literature) (TODO)
- Switch to parameterization based on f_sub rather than n_calib (check literature) (TODO)
- Have a cut to only use high-fidelity images (TODO)
- Get Einstein radius straight from sigma_v, no scatter (DONE)
- Advocate restricting \beta range (-2.5 to -1.5?)
- Reduce m_min to 1e6 * M_s (?)
- Restrict range of lens redshift
- Increase range of host mass

Problem(?): n_calib depends on beta. Possible solutions:
- Have independent pre-factor to dn/dm, then convert (to n_calib, f_sub) as needed?
- Use f_sub, explore universality

Notes:
- Save D_ls, D_l, D_s instead of redshifts?
